This repo contains the codes for my IEEE WCL paper named "DRL-based AoI-driven Scheduling for EH-enabled CR-NOMA IoT Networks with Queue Constraints". The aim of DRL here was to minimize the AOI under CR-NOMA based spectrum sharing by maintaining the QOS of PU. The RL agent selects the optimal SU in a particular time slot that can minimize the AOI of SU under QoS, buffer and Queue constraints.
